Soccer Team Roster Management System
This C++ program, main.cpp, is a simple soccer team roster management system created by Sharlotte Holmes on 9/12/23. It allows users to add, remove, update player ratings, display players above a certain rating threshold, and view the current soccer team roster. The program utilizes vectors to store player information, such as jersey numbers and ratings, and provides a menu-driven interface for user interaction.

Usage Instructions
Upon running the program, the user is prompted to input jersey numbers and ratings for five initial players. This forms the initial roster.

After entering the initial player information, the program displays a menu with the following options:

a - Add player: Allows the user to add a new player to the roster by entering their jersey number and rating.

d - Remove player: Enables the user to remove a player from the roster by entering their jersey number.

u - Update player rating: Allows the user to update the rating of a player by entering their jersey number and the new rating.

r - Output players above a rating: Displays players whose rating is above a specified threshold, which the user can input.

o - Output roster: Displays the current soccer team roster.

q - Quit: Exits the program.

The user can choose an option by entering the corresponding character. The program will execute the chosen action, and the user can continue using the menu until they choose to quit.
